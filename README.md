## Quantum-Reliable Key-Value Storage for the Modern Age

**Atomic Wave** is a high-performance, embedded key-value store written in Rust that guarantees ACD properties (Atomicity, Consistency, and Durability) for mission-critical data.

> *"Where data flows, reliability follows."*

## ✨ Features

- **Atomic Transactions**: All operations either completely succeed or completely fail
- **Crash Recovery**: Seamless recovery from unexpected shutdowns or crashes
- **Write-Ahead Logging**: Ensures durability of your data through power failures
- **Memory Efficient**: Low overhead even with large datasets
- **Zero-Copy Operations**: Optimized for high-throughput environments
- **Rust Safety Guarantees**: No segfaults, no memory leaks, no data races
- **Configurable Persistence**: Fine-tune your durability vs. performance tradeoffs

## 🚀 Quick Start

Add Atomic Wave to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
atomic_wave = "0.1.0"
```

Basic usage:

```rust
use atomic_wave::AtomicWave;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create a new database with default configuration
    let db = AtomicWave::new(Default::default())?;
    
    // Store some data
    db.put("hello", b"world")?;
    
    // Retrieve it
    let value = db.get("hello")?;
    assert_eq!(value.unwrap(), b"world");
    
    // Transactional operations
    db.begin_transaction()?;
    db.put("counter", b"1")?;
    db.put("status", b"initialized")?;
    db.commit_transaction()?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## 🧠 Philosophy

Atomic Wave was born from the realization that many embedded databases sacrifice either performance or reliability. We believe both are paramount. By leveraging Rust's ownership model and zero-cost abstractions, we've created a system that provides transactional guarantees without compromising on speed or memory usage.

## 🌱 Project Status

Atomic Wave is in alpha stage. 

## 🧩 Architecture

The heart of Atomic Wave is a carefully designed Write-Ahead Log (WAL) system combined with periodic snapshots:

1. **Command Processing**: Incoming operations are validated and prepared
2. **Log Appending**: Operations are serialized to the WAL before being applied
3. **Memory Application**: Successful operations modify the in-memory state
4. **Periodic Compaction**: The WAL is periodically compressed into snapshots
5. **Recovery Mechanism**: On startup, state is rebuilt from snapshots and WAL
